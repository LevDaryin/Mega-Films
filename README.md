# Mega-films

Website for viewing information about films.

This is the first pet project that aims to learn **React**. The site allows you to view information about films (title, year of release, genres), sort films by title and genre. More features are planned for the future. Using this project as an example, I studied the basic concepts of **React**, **fetch Api**, base **React Router** (planned - TypeScript, Redux, Firebase).
